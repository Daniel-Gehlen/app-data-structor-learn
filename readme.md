### About the Data Structures Project

This project is an interactive, browser-based tutorial designed to teach fundamental concepts of data structures. It covers classic structures such as **stacks**, **queues**, **linked lists**, **trees**, and **graphs**, offering explanations, code examples, and tools to experiment with how these structures work.

## Objectives

The project was created to help students and programming enthusiasts:
1. **Understand the basic concepts** of data structures.
2. **Visualize practical implementations** using JavaScript.
3. **Explore the logic behind the structures** with interactive examples.
4. **Practice coding and debugging** to solidify their understanding.

## Features

- **Interactive Examples**: Each data structure includes a short description, a working code example, and an option to test the code within the browser.
- **Responsive Design**: The interface is mobile-friendly and adaptable to various screen sizes.
- **Hands-on Learning**: Users can copy, modify, and run the provided code snippets to see how changes affect the output.
- **Simple and Modular**: The code is structured for easy understanding and reuse.

## Data Structures Covered

### 1. **Stacks**
- **Concept**: A stack follows the **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** principle.
- **Example Operations**: 
  - Push (add an item)
  - Pop (remove the most recently added item)

### 2. **Queues**
- **Concept**: A queue follows the **FIFO (First In, First Out)** principle.
- **Example Operations**:
  - Enqueue (add an item to the queue)
  - Dequeue (remove the earliest added item)

### 3. **Linked Lists**
- **Concept**: A sequence of elements where each element points to the next one.
- **Example Operations**:
  - Add a new node to the list.
  - Traverse and print all nodes.

### 4. **Trees**
- **Concept**: A hierarchical structure consisting of a root and branches, where each node may have child nodes.
- **Example Operations**:
  - Add nodes to the tree.
  - Traverse and print nodes in-order.

### 5. **Graphs**
- **Concept**: A collection of vertices connected by edges.
- **Example Operations**:
  - Add vertices and edges.
  - Display adjacency lists.

## Technology Stack

- **HTML**: For structuring the content.
- **CSS**: To style the user interface and make it visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: To provide interactivity and implement the logic for the data structures.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive design and UI components.

## How to Use

1. Navigate through the sections via the navigation bar.
2. Learn the concept and review the example code.
3. Use the "Check Code" button to see the code in action.
4. Experiment by modifying the code to observe how changes impact the results.
